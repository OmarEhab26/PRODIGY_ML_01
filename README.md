## Project Description

The aim of this project is to predict house prices using a linear regression model. The dataset is cleaned to remove outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. The features considered for prediction include:

- Lot Area
- Number of Bedrooms Above Ground
- Total Number of Bathrooms

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).

## Installation
